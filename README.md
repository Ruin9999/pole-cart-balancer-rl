# Pole cart balancing using PPO agent
A project used to get familiarized with reinforced learning and its algorithms, specifically [Proximity Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)

## Pre-determined Tasks
**Task 1** : Development of an RL agent. Demonstrate the correctness of the implementation by sampling a random state from the cart pole environment, inputting to the agent, and outputting a chosen action. Print the values of the state and chosen action in Jupyter notebook.  ✅

**Task 2** : Demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL agent. Run for 100 episodes (reset the environment at the beginning of each episode) and plot the cumulative reward against all episodes in Jupyter. Print the average reward over the 100 episodes. The average reward should be larger than 195. 🟨

**Task 3** : Render one episode played by the developed RL agent on Jupyter. ✅

**Task 4** : Format the Jupyter notebook by including step-by-step instruction and explanation, such that the notebook is easy to follow and run (refer to the tutorial section in the sample notebook). Include text explanation to demonstrate the originality of your implementation and your understanding of the code. For example, for each task, explain your approach and analyze the output; if you improve an existing approach, explain your improvements. ✅
